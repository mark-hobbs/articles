# Design space exploration

A visual guide to design space exploration and optimisation

## 1. Design space

Contour plot illustrating the relationship between two design parameters, $X_1$ and $X_2$, and the corresponding values of the objective function.

## 2. Grid search

Each point represents a single run of a computationally expensive simulation
